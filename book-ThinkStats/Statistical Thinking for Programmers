Data is cheap (at least relatively);knowledge is harder to come by.

Mean
-----
If you have a sample of n values, x i , the mean, \u03bc, is the sum of the values divided by the
number of values; in other words

                  --
 mean(miu) = 1/n  >  Xi
                  --
                  i
 -The “mean” of a sample is the summary statistic computed with the previous formula.
 -An “average” is one of many summary statistics you might choose to describe the
    typical value or the central tendency of a sample.

Variance
---------
 - If there is no single number that summarizes pumpkin weights, we can do a little better
    with two numbers: mean and variance.

 - the mean is intended to describe the central tendency, variance is
    intended to describe the spread.

##Things to remember
     - Mean , Variance,Averages, Standard Deviation, Diff between Mean and Avaerages
